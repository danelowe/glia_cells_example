# Glia Cells Example

This is an example application showing how [Glia](https://github.com/danelowe/glia) can work 
in conjunction with [Cells](https://github.com/apotonick/cells) to create a flexible layout with view models. 

This example showcases the basic features of Glia

Start the app with `bundle exec rackup`

## Unsure how to achieve something with Glia?
Just create an issue on this github project. 

I/Someone will hopefully look at what you want to do, and consider adding examples to this app based on your feedback. 

## TODO:

* Extend the registry helper to subscribe and access exposures from the controller. 
* Show wrapping a model in a cell in the render helper.
* Show additional features, such as areas, theme inheritance and actions
* Review what parts of this project can be extracted into a glia-cells gem.
* Extract app from rackup script
